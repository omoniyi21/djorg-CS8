My favorite software design method we have used us OOP. (Object Oriented Programming)
I enjoy the ability to use a logically method to eliminate errors. I find that 
this method works better with my learning and implmentation process. Having used 
Encapsulation 
Abstraction 
Inheritance 
& Polymorphism
I see the benefits in using object oriented programming and writing seamless code.
